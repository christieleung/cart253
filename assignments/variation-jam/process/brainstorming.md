## brainstorming

concept i'm choosing: a peek inside my head!
- features a girl with the top of her head open, with draggable objects inside
- use drawings instead of coded shapes
- different sound effects and background music in each variation
- variations:
  - when i'm daydreaming:
    - trail of rainbow stars when dragging 
  - when i'm stressed:
    - trail of dark-coloured swirls
    - make the movement jittery?
  - when i can't think / my brain feels empty:
    - make the cursor a pen
    - ink disappears right after being drawn? drawings stay all jumbled together?
- some fun ideas:
  - different cds/vinyls/music notes that play different songs when dragged
  - can also make it more of a sorting experience, with shadows / faint outlines of the objects surrounding the girl indicating where to place them


some other ideas i had:
- use game logistics of frogfrogfrog but change it to different ways to fall asleep:
    - counting (catching) sheep over the moon
    - catching stars
    - melatonin-induced 
- making magic potions!
  - drag ingredients into a cauldron
  - fashion, love, friend potions
- house tour
  - move around three different rooms or three versions of same room
- mazes
- clean up!
  - desktop, folders everywhere
  - room, maybe with some hidden notes to click on and clear away
  - nostaligic variation, in the dark variation?
- magnetic poetry
  - scattered words to place on a board with a fun background (gingham?)
  - magnetic noises when stuck
  - writer's block version (all blank? words disappear when you try to drag them?)
  - self-insert version (write your own words)
  - like-poles (magnets fall off when you try to drag them onto the board)
  - pictograph (image) version
