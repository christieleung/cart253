**Mod Jam Response!**

Lucas' version of *frogfrogfrog* was so complex! I loved how the game unfolded through three different stages and that the fly could actually fight back. The boss fly was a fun surprise (and how it later summoned fly minions too) and it was nerve-wracking to see it turn redder the angrier / more damaged it got! Using a jar of flies as the scoring system was such a creative idea, and the animated movement really made it seem like the flies were bouncing against the glass, fitting perfectly with the "fly revolt against frog injustice" theme. 

I also liked the moral aspect in the dialogue that popped up when eating the first few flies, acting as a brutal (30+ point) reminder that actions really do have consequences. The drastic change in music was also effective as it made the conflict feel much more intense as it transitioned from soft creek sounds to something more chaotic and layered. 

The code was so nicely organized, named, and described! The script for the play / restart button was especially satisfying to read with all the variables and operators, it must've been tricky to figure all that math out!

I really loved the wave background and how the colours got progressively darker to mimic diving deeper into the ocean. It was so impressive to see that the waves were not only made into a reuseable function, but that they were generated using Perlin noise! I was so mesmerized by this feature, and how it almost felt like the ocean was breathing as the waves rose and fell. It was also interesting to have the progress bar slightly glow and act as our only light source. I loved all the fish emojis and how they cemented the oceanic theme, and the way that the flies travelled in sine wave to match the motion of the water.

Even though I knew the ending would be a gold mine, I wasn't expecting gold coins to sparkle and bounce across the screen like that – it genuinely made me so happy! It was nice to be able to catch the flies at our own pace and that there was no way to lose the game. Everyone deserves a bit of treasure (and some cool, calming wave visuals)!

It's really cool to see how distinct Haolei's style has already become as there's always this playful sense of humour in their projects. The mod jam was no exception with how the flies evilly giggled at you when you missed, and how there was a "God of Frog" who could help by blessing you with an absurdly huge tongue.

I liked that the flies bounced off the edges of the canvas instead of flying off-screen, had semi-transparent flapping wings, and varied in size. All of these design features of the fly added so much depth to the game! Having the frog's eyes trail the fly movement was also a nice detail, I didn't even know that atan2() existed before this.

The title screen was also super fun (and maybe my favourite aspect)! I loved that the frog was catching flies in the corner, overlooking a beautiful green-blue gradient sky with soft clouds. It was really impressive to see that the cloud animation was coded to gently oscillate using sine and cosine, and to see so much trig packed into one project!
