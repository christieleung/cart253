I was so impressed by this project and genuinely can't comprehend how it's 3d! Using trigonometry to configure the composition and animation is such an incredible feat. The colour combinations were stunning, and I loved how you could spin the sphere in different directions and at different speeds (I spent ages playing with this). The pulsing effect that happened when you clicked or rotated the sphere was such a nice detail; it really emulated the motion of a bouncing ball and made the portrait feel like it was jumping out of the canvas. I also appreciated the tiny eyeballs on each sphere (and how they all followed the cursor position) as they added so much depth to the piece. I found it especially interesting how the larger eyes appeared somewhat disembodied as they rolled across the surface of the sphere, and how with so many eyes following the user's mouse, this portrait evoked ideas of voyeurism or surveillance. This was so crazy experimental and interactive!

This project was so cute and accurately titled because I did want to smile back at the portrait! I really loved the bubbles that gradually popped up on-screen over time; they were so relaxing to watch. The bow animations were also a nice touch, as they tied together the background elements (in shape and colour) and added a sense of cohesion. The vertices of the triangles for the bow wings were perfectly positioned too! I liked how there was a candy-like feel to the portrait, I'm not sure if this was a result of the shape of the bows, the double-bun hairstyle, or how the hair glows a caramel colour when interacted with, but these details created such a sweet, happy, and whimsical atmosphere. Ashmitha's code was also so intricately organized and well-explained! The use of arcs for the facial features was really nice too!

I'm not too familiar with Dragon Ball Z, but from the clips I've seen of Goku's transformation, I think the interactions were really accurate and effective! The idea of charging energy was super well conveyed through the shaking effects and flashing yellow lights, and how you could see/feel this power amplify the longer you pressed. I loved how the expression changed when you hovered over the eyes and how intense the portrait became, especially with the strobing rainbow pupils and sclera (the eyes did slightly scare me, but it was so fun to flip between modes). I was so amazed by how the transformation was constrained to the eyes, and how the spiky hair was drawn entirely from vertices! It was also cool how a hand was used as the cursor. I really liked how Haolei referenced an anime character that they love or maybe relate to for their self-portrait; it made it so much more personal!
