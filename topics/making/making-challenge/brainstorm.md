## brainstorming ideas!

1. frog's tongue twists (instead of shooting straight up, it twists randomly each time, or maybe it can be controlled with keys...kind of freaky)

2. tongue encircles fly to catch it (ex: draw tongue in a heart shape around the fly to eat it, tongue follows mouse movement)

3. frog wears hats (unlock certain hats once you've caught a certain number of flies: a beanie, a bow, a birthday hat! would need to implement some type of reward system so that every 10 flies, a different hat is added to the top of the frog's head, maybe a menu that can be toggled so you can choose which one to wear out of the collection you've earned)

4. frog can jump! maybe onto some lilypads (add some fun scenery, would also need to draw frog body, control movement with keyboard)

5. frog has expressions (hurt when the tongue touches the edge of the canvas, sad when the fly escapes, maybe frog colour can be changed to expres this (blue is sad, red is angry) or add eyebrows? since mouth expressions don't really work as the tongue is launching from all sides of the head)

6. fly family revenge (an angry swarm of flies occasionally appear on-screen after a fly is caught, maybe the frog runs away (moves off the canvas)? or fights back and swallows them all? choices can pop up on-screen for user to choose reaction)

7. bad prey (throw a bee in there?, integrate a point system and deduct points if wrong bug or object is swallowed, frog dies so game over?) 

8. frog competition (another frog comes on-screen occasionally and eats your fly or a random net catches them?)

9. fly swatting (the movement of the frog tongue and fly are somehow automated, the mouse is a fly swatter)

10. frog indigestion (after a certain number of flies or if they are caught too fast, the frog burps and all the caught flies fly out...would the flies be dead or alive? would you be able to eat them again? would you want to?)

11. flies have voices ("nooo don't eat me!" "it's my birthday!" "i have a family", adds a philosophical element)

12. we follow the caught fly down the frog's digestive tract (do we then play as the fly? can we escape?)

13. caught flies go into a jar, and once a sufficient number has been caught (10?), we switch to a cooking scene where you get to plate the flies or make a meal, because the frog is a chef (would the frog have arms to catch them? are we just assuming the frog spits them back out into the jar?) 

14. bloated frog (draw frog belly, the more flies consumed, the greater the bloat, can the frog pop? will the tongue start moving slower? can we do debloating exercises?) 

15. frog has blurry vision (the whole screen is blurry or very pixelated so it's hard to see)

16. frog is a vegetarian (maybe there are plants that line the canvas that the tongue gravitates towards when launches so you have to try to force the direction towards the flies, or don't and comply with dietary restrictions? maybe we can make a protest sign advocating for fly freedom instead by drawing with the mouse)

17. frog is sleepy (tongue can't be launched when asleep, wake up frog by clicking on the head, slowly starts to blink to hint at this)

18. once tongue makes contact with fly, user needs to play a tapping or rhythm game to reel it in (the screen pauses, and user has to go through a series of mouse clicks or key presses or combos to successfully catch it)

19. magical bonus flies that grant powers (a special fly (different colour, glow, sparkle, size?) occasionally pops up and if caught, maybe the frog temporarily gains a second tongue, can freeze fly moment? (fly catching frenzy!), frog would be rainbow during this time)

20. singing frog (depending on direction and how long tongue stretches, a different chord plays in a matching pitch, so if the tongue is launched a short distance at the bottom right edge, a deep, low sound plays until tongue retracts back into mouth)
